- [禮多人不怪](http://chengyu.game2.tw/archives/42046) means courtesy costs nothing. It came from a 1903 book, 官場現形記, by yet another [Mr Li](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9D%8E%E5%AF%B6%E5%98%89).
- Developers, get a plan B. Software development as a lifelong career is statistically absurd. If you aren't the top 1%, chances are you won't remain a 65-year old software wizard (i.e. architect). If you aren't going to be a wizard, then perhaps think if you can be a manager. But only 10% can be a manager. So what are the other 89% going to do? **You need a plan B**. Be a plumber, realtor, [home inspector](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/dlyup2/good_paying_jobs_with_minimal_post_secondary/), casino dealer, bus driver, air traffic controller, water treatment, CP rail, welding, or something.
- To be a mature person, [you can't just downplay everything](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-differences-between-an-immature-and-mature-person): you still need to be serious when you encounter a serious issue. So to be a mature person, you first need to know what is serious and what is not.
- Whenever you feel you should keep quiet to avoid confrontation, remember this was what the Republic of China said to its troops when Japan started its invasion: "須萬分容忍，不與抵抗，以免事態擴大" (need to tolerate everything they do, do not resist, lest we make the situation worse).
- If your (a daughter) dad wants your child to keep your last name, that means [he doesn't like your husband and want you to ditch him](https://www.zhihu.com/question/346165736/answer/825761423).

- "Working as hard as you can" doesn't mean not resting and burning out. It means putting maximum sustained load on yourself.
- [People are waiting for you to fail](https://seekingmyutopia.com/2019/01/22/people-are-waiting-for-you-to-fail/). They will bring you down. The only person you can trust to keep you positive, all the time, is _yourself_. As an aside, you are not anyone else's responsibility. You and you alone are responsible for your physical, mental, and social wellbeing.
- "Never let an animal see you as 'the path of least resistance.'" - /u/Quinn_tEskimo's grandpa
- There isn't a purpose in life. Your purpose in life is what you make it, [and that will keep you busy until it is time for you to exit the stage.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/c7oj0c/how_do_you_not_question_the_point_of_life_all_the/)
- If you do your day job properly, and you happen to be good at doing screener tests, you don't really need personal projects to back up your skills. Since personal projects are personal, you rarely reach the required depth of knowledge that people expect, anyway.
- I was told you can prank your colleagues, but you can't prank your boss.
- You can't blame your parents (or the boomers) for everything: "... the final forming of a person's character lies in their own hands" - Anne Frank
- For appointments that have late cancellation fees, check if you can bump the appointment up for free. If it is free to do so, then bump the appointment up enough that the late cancellation time no longer applies.
- "Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless - like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend." - Bruce Lee, in a show called "Longstreet"
- "Challenges are gifts that force us to search for a new center of gravity. Don't fight them, just find a new way to stand." - Oprah

- /u/Festivearea2's psychiatrist, Dr Murphy: "No one gives a shit about you." He meant and explained it as, in life there are very very very few people who will be there for you all the time, and drop everything. No one cares about what you're doing because everyone is selfish. That's just how life is. Do what YOU want to do, because it's YOUR life.
- Blogs ideally teach others what you learned, not just rambling. (But you can... it's your own blog, I'm not the police)

- When booking an AirBnB, [look for cameras literally everywhere](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/05/08/airbnb_host_jailed/). They can be hidden in cushions, lamps, as one of the lights in the router, behind mirrors...
- When someone asks "Where are you from" or "What do you do", try to respond the question with something that relates to the asker. For "What do you do", _you_ should not be asking it because not everyone is proud of what they do. If you are the one answering "What do you do", then attempt to add the word "help" into the response, i.e. ["I help people get the best Japanese candies the country has to offer,"](https://www.candyjapan.com/) rather than "I run a website that sells Japanese candies". A valid alternative to "What do you do" is "How do you spend most of your time".

- "Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones." - not necessarily Marcus Aurelius, but attributed to him anyway
- ["I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to "not matter". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hax0t/-/c1u0rx2) - /u/GSnow

- The No Tech Magazine [once](https://www.notechmagazine.com/2019/01/the-complication-of-leisure.html) suggested that the tools used for hobbies ("boating, bicycling, skiing or backpacking") are being improved by manufacturer, so much so that we forget what we actually want out of the hobby. Doing traditional archery, for example, ["promotes a sense of fun and encourages a carefree spirit."](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/720481.The_Traditional_Bowyer_s_Bible_Volume_1)
- [Welcome criticism.](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/3ocfXMjBajIvUKiSQDMbog) If you don't take criticism well, you can't improve at a rate above average. If a Chinese website laughs at Hong Kong people for speaking broken Mandarin, you welcome the criticism. You practice the **fuck** out of your Mandarin. 香港人，記住唔好衰俾人睇。You improve beyond their imagination, exceeding their proficiency in their own native (and sometimes, only) tongue. And then you _don't_ laugh at their broken English, because doing so will give them the idea to improve it.
- [Let people play their music in your car](https://www.reddit.com/r/InfluenceAdvice/comments/adtfr4/why_you_should_let_others_play_music_in_the_car/): not only does it improve the probability that at least one person (the one who's playing the music) likes the music currently playing; "Similar to the Ben Franklin effect, the acceptance of their gesture to play the songs they like will make these people like you. They will feel as if their interests are affirmed and that they've helped improve the social setting around them."

- When your married relationship turns sour, quit your job. When a divorce takes place, you get half. This does not work if the other person is also unemployed, and it doesn't work in Canada, because the law uses your income in the last three years to counter situations like this.
- According to [random people on the Internet working on an app](https://hbr.org/2016/03/why-your-late-twenties-is-the-worst-time-of-your-life), you won't be an actual adult until you get married and have kids; and, before then, you will live the worst time of your life.
- [Dead end careers](https://www.zippia.com/research/dead-end-careers/) seem to be the ones that end up having a low max-earning potential. On the flip side, lawyers earn almost twice as much as everybody else, but they are useless without clients.
- You can calculate how much you need to invest into your retirement by reverse calculating from how much you want every month (no taxes for simplicity). Say you want $10k in passive income every month in whichever currency. A year of that is $120k, and if you say you get that much from a 5% capital growth per year, then your actual investment is 120k / 5% = 2.4M. So you will have to figure out how to get this 2.4M in 20 years. 2.4M in 20 years is (interestingly enough) back to 120k per year. So unless you save 10k every month now, you aren't retiring.
